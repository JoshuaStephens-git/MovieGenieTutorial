## **Important: This is a Work in Progress** 

Welcome to The Movie Genie! Please be aware that this repository is an **active work in progress**. It serves as the foundation for a comprehensive, multi-hour tutorial series on building a full-stack web application from scratch.

**What this means for you:**
